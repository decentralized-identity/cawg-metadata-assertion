=== History

In versions 1.3 and earlier of the link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[C2PA technical specification], there were individual assertions for each metadata standard (e.g., IPTC, EXIF).
These were coalesced into link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_common_metadata++[a single “common” metadata assertion] in version 1.4 of the specification.
In link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#metadata_annex++[version 2.0 of the C2PA technical specification], new restrictions were added as to which metadata content could be reflected in the built-in `c2pa.metadata` assertion.

This specification is not a product of the C2PA, but provides a mechanism for metadata that can no longer be expressed in the `c2pa.metadata` assertion to be included in a C2PA Manifest.
