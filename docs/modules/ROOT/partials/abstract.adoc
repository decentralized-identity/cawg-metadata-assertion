The *link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[C2PA technical specification]* allows actors in a workflow to make cryptographically signed assertions about the produced C2PA asset.

This specification describes a C2PA assertion referred to here as the *metadata assertion* that can be added to a C2PA Manifest to allow metadata from various metadata standards (including, but not limited to, XMP, IPTC, and Exif) to be cryptographically bound to the C2PA Manifest.

This specification differs from the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_metadata++[`c2pa.metadata` assertion] from the C2PA technical specification in that there are no restrictions on the metadata fields which can be represented.
