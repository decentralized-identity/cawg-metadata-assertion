The *link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[C2PA technical specification]* allows actors in a workflow to make cryptographically signed assertions about the produced C2PA asset.

This specification describes a C2PA assertion referred to here as the *metadata assertion,* binding metadata from standards such as XMP, IPTC, and Exif to a C2PA Manifest in a tamper-evident way.

Unlike the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_metadata++[c2pa.metadata assertion] from the C2PA technical specification, this specification places no restrictions on which metadata fields may be included. This flexibility allows it to support a broader set of use cases and makes it well-suited for use in `gathered_assertions` in the link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_schema[C2PA Claim schema], where the signer of the C2PA Manifest does not attest to the accuracy of the provided metadata but still ensures the integrity of the C2PA Manifest.
