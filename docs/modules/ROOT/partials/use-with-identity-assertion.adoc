== Use with identity assertion

The CAWG *metadata assertion* facilitates the delivery of metadata that is not directly generated by a C2PA claim generator. This can often mean the metadata is generated by humans, either as individuals or as part of an organization.

When the authorship of metadata included in a CAWG *metadata assertion* is known, the CAWG *metadata assertion* SHOULD be included as a _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_referenced_assertions++[referenced assertion]_ within a CAWG _link:https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/[identity assertion]._
This reference SHOULD be understood as:

. an indication that the _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_named_actor++[named actor]_ of the _link:https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/[identity assertion]_ has provided (directly or indirectly) the metadata in this *metadata assertion,* and
. an attestation by the _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_named_actor++[named actor]_ to the validity of the metadata provided.
