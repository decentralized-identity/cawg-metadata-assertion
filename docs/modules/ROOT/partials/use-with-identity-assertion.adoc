== Use with identity assertion

The CAWG *metadata assertion* exists primarily to permit the delivery of metadata that is not directly generated by a capture device or edit tool, in other words authored by humans, either as individuals or as part of an organization.

Therefore, a CAWG *metadata assertion* SHOULD be included as a _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_referenced_assertions++[referenced assertion]_ within a CAWG _link:https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/[identity assertion]._
This reference SHOULD be understood as:

. an indication that the _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_named_actor++[named actor]_ of the _link:https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/[identity assertion]_ has provided the metadata in this *metadata assertion,* and
. an attestation by the _link:++https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/#_named_actor++[named actor]_ to the validity of the metadata provided.
